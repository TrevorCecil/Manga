<h1>Car Rental system</h1>

<p>Many travelers take renting a car for granted especially during the pandemic when isolation is a priority. Customers prefer convenient and timely service, but it's not uncommon for car rentals to lag. Roughly speaking, vehicle pick-ups delay every third time. Considering the tight competition in this business landscape, car rental services canâ€™t fail to satisfy their customers.
